    <h1>Top 5 Resume Mistakes to Avoid</h1>
    <p>Many job seekers unknowingly make critical mistakes on their resumes, costing them valuable opportunities. 
       Avoiding these errors can significantly improve your chances of landing an interview. Below are the top five 
       resume mistakes and how to fix them.</p>

    <h2>1. Using a Generic Resume for Every Job</h2>
    <p>One of the biggest mistakes job seekers make is submitting the same resume for multiple job applications. 
       Hiring managers look for tailored resumes that align with the specific job description.</p>
    <h3>How to Fix It:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Customize your resume for each position by incorporating relevant keywords.</li>
        <li>Highlight skills and experiences that match the job description.</li>
        <li>Use a strong summary that reflects your fit for the role.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. Including Too Much or Too Little Information</h2>
    <p>Some resumes are either overloaded with unnecessary details or too vague to be meaningful.</p>
    <h3>How to Fix It:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Keep your resume concise, ideally one page (two pages for experienced professionals).</li>
        <li>Focus on quantifiable achievements rather than listing responsibilities.</li>
        <li>Use bullet points to make content easy to scan.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Poor Formatting and Readability</h2>
    <p>Messy formatting, excessive fonts, or lack of structure can make your resume difficult to read. 
       Recruiters spend an average of <b>6-7 seconds</b> on an initial scan of a resume.</p>
    <h3>How to Fix It:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Use a professional, easy-to-read font (Arial, Calibri, or Times New Roman).</li>
        <li>Maintain consistent spacing, headings, and bullet points.</li>
        <li>Avoid large paragraphs—stick to structured sections with clear headings.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Not Highlighting Achievements</h2>
    <p>A resume should showcase accomplishments rather than just listing duties. Employers want to see the impact you had in previous roles.</p>
    <h3>How to Fix It:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Use numbers and data to quantify your achievements (e.g., "Increased sales by 25% in six months").</li>
        <li>Start bullet points with strong action verbs like "Led," "Developed," "Optimized," etc.</li>
        <li>Use our <a href="/">Resume Bullet Point Generator</a> to create effective, results-driven resume bullet points.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. Ignoring ATS (Applicant Tracking Systems)</h2>
    <p>Many companies use ATS to scan resumes before they reach human recruiters. If your resume isn’t optimized for ATS, it may never be seen.</p>
    <h3>How to Fix It:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Use standard section headings like “Work Experience” and “Skills.”</li>
        <li>Avoid images, graphics, and excessive formatting that ATS may not recognize.</li>
        <li>Use keywords from the job description to improve your ATS ranking.</li>
    </ul>
