    <h1>How to Write Effective Resume Bullet Points</h1>
    <p>Your resume is your first impression, and strong bullet points can make all the difference in landing an interview. 
       Instead of listing job duties, focus on achievements that showcase your impact. Below are some key strategies to write 
       effective resume bullet points that will grab a hiring manager’s attention.</p>

    <h2>1. Start with a Strong Action Verb</h2>
    <p>Avoid generic phrases like “Responsible for” or “Worked on.” Instead, begin each bullet point with a strong action verb 
       that highlights your contribution. Examples include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Designed</b> and implemented a new customer service workflow, reducing response time by 35%.</li>
        <li><b>Managed</b> a team of 10 employees, increasing department productivity by 20%.</li>
        <li><b>Developed</b> a new marketing campaign that resulted in a 15% increase in brand engagement.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. Quantify Your Achievements</h2>
    <p>Employers want to see measurable results. Whenever possible, include numbers to give your bullet points more impact.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Increased</b> sales revenue by <b>30%</b> in six months through targeted advertising strategies.</li>
        <li><b>Reduced</b> customer complaints by <b>40%</b> by implementing a proactive support system.</li>
        <li><b>Cut</b> production costs by <b>$50,000</b> annually by optimizing supplier contracts.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Highlight Problem-Solving and Initiative</h2>
    <p>Employers value employees who can solve problems and take initiative. Think about challenges you faced at work and 
       describe how you tackled them.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identified inefficiencies in inventory management and <b>developed</b> a tracking system that reduced waste by 25%.</li>
        <li>Led the redesign of the company’s website, <b>improving</b> user experience and boosting engagement by 50%.</li>
        <li>Streamlined the onboarding process for new hires, <b>reducing</b> training time from four weeks to two.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Use Concise and Impactful Language</h2>
    <p>Keep your bullet points short and to the point. Avoid unnecessary words and ensure each statement delivers value.</p>

    <h2>5. Tailor Bullet Points to Each Job</h2>
    <p>Customize your resume for each application by aligning bullet points with the job description. Use keywords from the job 
       posting to improve your chances of passing applicant tracking systems (ATS).</p>

    <h2>6. Example of Weak vs. Strong Bullet Points</h2>
    <p>Here’s a before-and-after example of a weak vs. strong bullet point:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Weak:</b> Worked on marketing campaigns.</li>
        <li><b>Strong:</b> Developed and launched a social media marketing campaign that increased follower engagement by 50%.</li>
    </ul>
